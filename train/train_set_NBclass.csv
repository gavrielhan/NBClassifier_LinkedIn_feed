(Petit bain: Windsor 2016 argent 4x100nl).Une semaine de compétition aux Championnats d’Europe de natation à Rome qui se termine de la plus belle des façons. Le début de la semaine s’est fait en individuel. Je suis allé jusqu’en demi-finale sur le 100m papillon pour finir top 11 européen. La fin de semaine s’est faite en équipe. On ne le dit jamais assez, on est toujours plus fort en équipe et surtout bien accompagné. C’est donc avec les copains du relais 4x100m 4n (Yohann, Antoine et Maxime), que nous avons remporté une magnifique médaille d’argent. Tout ça derrière les italiens (champions du monde en titre), chez eux, dans la plus belle piscine du monde en ébullition. C’était la dernière course de la compétition, mais aussi de la saison. Une saison de dingue avec des hauts toujours plus hauts. Des championnats universitaires canadiens, aux championnats de France, en passant par les championnats du Monde à Budapest, et en finissant aux Euros à Rome. Mais, je n’oublie pas comment s’est terminée la dernière saison. Soit, bien au fond du trou à Chartres pour les sélections Olympiques, avec des résultats qui étaient très loin de ce que je fournissais à l’entraînement. Parfois il ne faut rien lâcher et patienter pour récolter les fruits de son travail. Je suis tellement reconnaissant de pouvoir vivre de telles expériences.Merci pour les souvenirs.

While speaking at a teens church tech training last week I said that if apple starts making shirts I will never wear another brand again. I call it the Steve Jobs effect.Truth is, as much as I love this brand, I’m not happy with how slow they are innovating. iPhone X was the real revolution for apple but after that, nothing really revolutionary has been done in 11,12,13 and now iPhone 14.Yes the software keeps getting better and Tim Cook has showed his business prowess by making other apple services like Health & Fitness, Apple TV, Apple Music etc more mainstream and 100x the companies revenue.But we miss what apple is known for, we miss the Steve Jobs effect - revolution. We were always holding our breath for what Jobs will do next. I keep wondering if he were alive today how he would view technology, what anti-establishment invention will he be working on? How much would the iPhone had changed if he were still here?There’s something about companies losing their luster when the founders step away or die.

By definition, you get stuck in a vicious loop of not feeling good enough, and then not being able to snap out of it - preventing you from doing anything at all. Sometimes you just need to stop. Go for a walk, make a coffee, chat to a friend. Allowing yourself to focus on something else helps to break the cycle, and you can come back with a set of fresh eyes. 💡 Added benefit: the time off gives your brain time to passively process and think in the background about whatever you were doing before you stopped - so you're benefiting from the break in more ways than one 🚀 ~~~~We all know that it's one of the most common feelings out there - so I'd love to hear any other tips that you have for managing your Imposter Syndrome!

In the same timeframe, the conversion rates across retail sites like Ebay, BestBuy and AliExpress have stagnated at under 5%.But how? 👀➡️ The ability for Amazon to thrive in a less favorable economic climate may be down to a number of factors... However, my best guess is that Amazon has continued to hone its recommendation algorithm, such that visitors are increasingly being shown precisely what they are looking for – and sooner.✅ This isn’t to say the company won’t face some pain, should the job market take a dive or the cost of living increase further. A drop in the amount of disposable income in circulation is bound to hurt. However, what’s certain is that the difficulties facing Amazon in the #ecommerce market will pale in comparison to those suffered by its competition.",0

Moreover, the establishment of the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute in New York together with Cornell University generated a very positive attitude towards Israel and towards the Technion’s contribution to New York City’s economic development.”His visit focused on research collaborations and the importance of diversity in academia – a subject close to the ambassador’s heart. Technion President Prof. Uri Sivan emphasized the importance of opening the doors of the Technion to every talented young man and woman: “The Technion offers students an extensive support network through special scholarships and loans, since we are committed to ensuring that no student will stop studying due to financial difficulties.”Read the full story: https://lnkd.in/dX5SgqfM Cornell Tech U.S. Department of State #technology #development #diversity #network #research #collaboration #startup #students #university #science Boaz Golany Wayne Kaplan Oded Rabinovitch Adi Salzberg",0

71,"There's 3 things HubSpot did to get to SEO dominance that no one talks about. Similarweb estimates that the HubSpot website got 40.2M visits last month with ~34% of it from search. For comparison, they also estimate that Adobe Marketo gets 1.1M visitors & Databox gets 812k.  Clearly, HubSpot is crushing SEO. Kudos to the marketing team, of course. They've done a lot of things really well that you'd expect them to do:  ✔️  Publishing high volumes of content✔️ All the SEO best practices (keyword research, pillar & clusters, well-optimized content, internal linking, updating old content, etc)✔️ Earning back links & a high domain authority by publishing un-duplicatable content. But, there are 3 much more complicated, much more strategic things HubSpot also did that I've never seen anyone talk about. I don't think these are secrets per se. It's more likely HubSpot just took these things for granted after awhile. Or maybe just never really thought that deeply about them because they were happy coincidences. Here they are...1. Website grader (WSG) attracted a massive amount of links in the early days. The report used to link to blog posts. This helped our blog content get a lot of attention & attract a lot more links. Wanna crush your SEO? Build a free tool. (A Databox free tool -- a next  level WSG -- is launching imminently. Woot woot!) 2. Partners linked to HubSpot prodigiously. As my old-ass article titled, ""Did you graduate high  school link building yet?"" (that WSG helped make famous) states, the hardest part of SEO is link building. The best links are the ones you get because your content is so great people voluntarily link to it. Well, HubSpot partners link to HubSpot on their home page & services pages, from blog posts, etc. Some of them put their badge in the footer of their site, so that every single page of their website links to HubSpot! Early on, Patrick Shea & I realized that if we gave partners early access to feature launch info, they'd publish an article for every launch, instantly getting us on page one. More importantly, think about the domain authority boost this has given HubSpot over time & try not to salivate. If you're in SEO, you should be begging your company to start a partner program. 3. Launching new products. When HubSpot launched their first product for salespeople, it wasn't CRM. In fact, I bet most HubSpot partners today couldn't even tell you what it did. But, a really smart thing HubSpot also launched at the same time was a sales blog. In the first year of launching it, I wrote 42 articles for it. We were able to rank for new sales-related keywords at will. HubSpot's new products allowed them to expand their SEO footprint considerably. They now rank #2 for ""CRM"". Launching new products in new categories is a key SEO power move. Chances are, your current product is fighting for rankings against loads of competitors. It's hard to get incremental gains. New products opens up new SEO universes.",0

73,"E’ uno scherzo ? Oppure una fake news? ….👇Le difficoltà a realizzare qualunque impianto o infrastruttura sul territorio italiano  🇮🇹 sono note.. Ma qui si va oltre il ridicolo, sfociando nell’autolesionismo puro e sempliceDi fronte ad una crisi energetica senza precedenti, un paese che è un grande consumatore e importatore di energia ha sostanzialmente due misure immediate per cercare di proteggersi. La prima è efficienza energetica, qualcosa che si materializzerà presto ahimè se non altro per i prezzi ‘astronomici’ delle bollette che diventeranno la prima preoccupazione al ritorno dal periodo vacanziero (oltre a una riduzione di consumi dovuta a imprese che saranno costrette a chiudere…) La seconda misura è creare sistemi di approvvigionamento energetico alternativi. E qui le rinnovabili – per quanto non l’unica e non risolutrice in toto - sono una soluzione importantissima. Perchè in principio quelle maggiormente accettate dai cittadini e perchè i tempi di realizzazione sarebbero (in teoria) i più veloci tra le varie infrastrutture energetiche. Non rendere tutto ciò possibile non è una scelta. E’ semplicemente un suicidio economico, sociale e culturale. Si possono avere paesaggi immacolati, campi verdi, orizzonti liberi.

But, it’s through the kind of ground-breaking research this donation will fund that we’ll be able speed up the therapies and treatments that change this. Charlotte approached everything full of energy and passion, and we’re proud to be the cause she thought of. We’re grateful to her family, friends and colleagues who donated thanks to her.”",1

117,"Can sim2robot transfer be improved by *decreasing* simulation fidelity? Surprisingly, yes! Research by FAIR and College of Computing at Georgia Tech finds that nav policies trained with *lower* fidelity physics sim resulted in *higher* zero-shot sim2real transfer on Boston Dynamics Spot.Low-fidelity sim (Kinematics) = teleporting robot. High-fidelity sim (Dynamics) = actuating robot footsteps. Insight: Don’t train to actuate footsteps in dynamic sim. Train high-level (teleportation) policies in kinematic sim + use low-level hardware controllers. Why? Because (1) training w/ kinematic-sim is 20x faster so policies learn from more 20x more experience. And (2) no sim is ever perfect; simulating at a lower fidelity reduces overfitting to the inaccuracies of sim. We hope our work triggers a rethink in how researchers pursue sim2real and develop the simulators of tomorrow. Our recommendation: prioritize simulation speed not fidelity (for tasks that can be represented with abstract action spaces). Details:  arxiv.org/abs/2207.10821",0

Is it having lots of money?Getting a promotion?If we look at some of the most successful people in the world, we can see a trend…Be it Aristotle…“Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work”Or Steve Jobs..“The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.”Bottom line - Self Satisfaction is vital.Find your peace in the little things, the little successes along the way.Take note of the days where you find a reason to smile in your job or a sense of achievement, even if it’s just helping your colleague decide what to eat for lunch. After all, Rome wasn’t built in a day. #success #thoughtoftheday #work",0

""There is something infinitely touching when an artist, in old age, takes on simplicity. The artist is saying: display and bravura are tricks for the young, and yes, showing off is part of ambition; but now that we are old, let us have the confidence to speak simply.""💡You don't have to be approaching old age to embrace simplicity, to begin to apply the learning and understanding gained through experience, your own or that of others.Simplicity in our design, services, programs, companies, and even our lives is a critical element to making things better. Even if you aren't at the end of a long career, think about how you would approach work if you were.How would you simplify and focus on only the vital things?What would you do differently?Your Daily Ikigai, today is about taking action over waiting for inspiration.

Even better, there’s already a drug we can use to do it.The drug, called vismodegib, can inhibit Hedgehog signals in our bodies, and this can potentially prevent certain immune cells from causing the chronic inflammation we see in IBD.This new course of treatment isn’t as a permanent fix for IBD, however it can slow down the progression of the disease and therefore lower the risk of bowel cancer in IBD patients, as well as opening up a whole host of possibilities for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. https://bit.ly/3wljfdA",1

200,"JWhy should we learn to translate Statistics? There are two main ways that I have found to learn formulas and concepts in statistics: 1.     Memorize formulas. 2.     Understand the idea behind it. Although Some of us might find it easier to keep statistics in the realm of rules, I found that I understand concepts better when I can explain to myself (and others) the idea behind it. This enables me not only to understand the concept I’m studying better but also to apply the same logic to many other concepts in the world of statistics. Furthermore, while I am a huge statistics geek, I accept that most people I am surrounded by are in fact not huge fans of statistics. So, in order to convey my work to others from different fields I must learn to translate it to a language others speak. One amazing example of this way of looking at statistics is the YouTube channel “StatQuest” by Joshua Starmer PhD . Each video discusses and explains a specific concept and in my opinion does a great job at explaining the ideas behind these concepts and translating statistics into plain English. Please let me know if you already have a favorite video (I have a few) and of your favorite YouTube channel for learning statistics. MASSIVE BAM! #statistics #learning #video # ",0
